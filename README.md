# Budget-Tracker
This Python budget tracker helps you manage personal finances by storing a monthly budget and recording expenses across categories. It calculates total spending, shows how much remains, and provides a category-wise summary. Simple, offline, and file-based, it keeps your data saved for ongoing tracking and financial awareness.
The Budget Tracker is a Python-based command-line application for managing personal finances in a simple and organized way. It allows users to set a monthly budget, record expenses, and monitor spending habits with category-based summaries. When the program starts, an interactive menu is displayed with five options. Option 1 lets you set or update your monthly budget, for example entering “1000” will set your total spending limit to $1000 for the month. Option 2 allows you to add an expense by entering the amount, category, and an optional note; for instance, entering “50” under amount, “Food” as the category, and “Groceries” as the note will record a $50 grocery expense. Option 3 displays your budget status, showing the initial budget, total spent so far, and the remaining balance, for example “Budget: $1000 | Spent: $250 | Remaining: $750.” Option 4 provides a spending summary with a category-wise breakdown of all expenses, such as “Food: $150, Transport: $75, Entertainment: $25,” making it easy to see where your money is going. Option 5 exits the program but ensures that all data is saved for the next time you run it. The application stores your budget in a text file and your expenses in a CSV file, preserving data across sessions while keeping everything fully offline. This makes the Budget Tracker a lightweight yet effective tool for personal finance management, giving users a practical way to stay on top of their monthly spending.
